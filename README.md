# 🖌 Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thank you to [makeareadme.com](https://gitlab.com/-/experiment/new_project_readme_content:112170ba92302fd598fe551d2c1f9730?https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## 🧐 Suggestions for a good README

Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## 🌱 Name

Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## 🔍 Description

Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## ✅ Badges ⛔️

On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## 📸 Visuals

Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## 📦 Installation

Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## 👩‍💻 Usage

Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## 🚑 Support

Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## 🛣 Roadmap

If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## 💪 Contributing

State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## 🤝 Authors and acknowledgment

Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## 🎫 License

For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## 🚧 Project status

If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.

## ⁉️ Questions and answers

### Why TypesScript ???

-   Improves a lot the development experience. Has a lot of features that JavaScript does not have. Having a strong sinergy with Webpack, Babel, and
    ES Lint. Types makes the code basis easier to read and mantain. And it also boosts your knowledge about React and JavaScript. Since we have to care
    about every type of JSX Elements, DOM Events, functions, objects, and so on.
-   Customize our projects configurations connecting plugins with Webpack, Babel, and ES Lint. Imports management, folder and file paths alias, and
    others environments options. Are all available on `tsconfig.json` file.

### What is Webpack ???

-   Webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency
    graph from one or more entry points and then combines every module your project needs into one or more bundles, which are static assets to serve
    your content from. [Concepts](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/)

### What is Babel ???

-   Babel is a JavaScript compiler
-   See also [don-t-use-create-react-app-how-you-can-set-up-your-own-reactjs-boilerplate](https://dev.to/nikhilkumaran/don-t-use-create-react-app-how-you-can-set-up-your-own-reactjs-boilerplate-43l0)

### What is ES Lint ???

-   ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs.
-   Ensures that every person that is working on this code basis is writing on the same pattern. Following the same linting rules and avoiding anti-patterns from being commited and pushed. Combined with Husky.
-   See also [eslint-plugin](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html#eslint-plugin)

### What is Prettier ???

-   An opinionated code formatter. You press save and code is formatted.
-   Need to install Prettier extension for yor IDE in order to automate foarmat on save and/or format on paste options.

### What is Stylelint ???

-   Same as ES Lint but for styles files like .scss, .css, .less, etc.

### Why we have node-version and nvmrc ???

-   To ensure all environments that are running this application are also running the same Node version.

### What is editorconfig ???

-   EditorConfig helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors and IDEs.

### Why SASS ???

-   CSS is hard to maintain. SASS is more porwerfull 💥. And there are plenty of UI libraries that supports SASS.
-   UI libraries that supports SASS:
    -   [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/customize/sass/)
    -   [Material Design](https://material.io/develop/web/getting-started)
    -   [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/sass.html)

### Why we have index ejs instead of index html ???

-   Webpack relative or absolute path to the template. By default it will use src/index.ejs if it exists. Please see the docs for details.
-   EJS is just a way to warite some JS on HTML. Since we need to capture values from HtmlWebpackPlugin.
-   See [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin#options)
-   See also [template-option](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin/blob/main/docs/template-option.md)

### Why we have this ugly `__tests__` folder ???

-   The main idea here is to keep all files related to tests separated from others `src` folder files. By doing this, we prevent Webpack
    to load files with .test and .spec extensios. And other files that are only useful on test environment. Like mocks, Provider and jest-setup
    from utils.
-   `coverage` is a special folder that comes in when any test is runned. This is an automatic configuration placed on `jest.config.js` on key `coverageDirectory`
-   Unit tests will be applied to components, layouts, and pages.
-   End-to-End tests will be runned with Cypress further.

### What is Husky ???

-   Husky improves your commits and more 🐶 woof!
-   To avoid having unlinted code in our repository, what we can do is add ESLint at one point of our process using Git Hooks. Like Husky!

### Why Redux not Context API ???

### What is the folder `common/` for ???

---

# ⚠️ Troubleshooting

-   On deploy, you must set build production folder to `dist/` instead of `/`.

-   Open an issue ⚠️

---

# 📑 To do

-   Configure Cypress for End-to-End tests

-   Implement Husky pre-push hook with tests
